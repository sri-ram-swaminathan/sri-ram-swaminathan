👋🏽 Well Hello There

My name is Sriram. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Physics and Mathematics. I want to pursue a Master's in Data Science. I am passionate about using my technical skills to make a positive impact using data.

I consider myself to be a detective 🕵🏽‍♂️, using Statistical Analysis powered by Computer Programming to draw Inferences from the messy world of Data!

Currently, I am:
- Dusting off my to-be-read pile
- Working through Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra textbook
- Learning Machine Learning

I played football semi-professionally until 2021 and enjoy being in nature, especially in the company of elephants 🐘

Here is a list of all the projects I have worked on :
